# MIDI Turing Machine

This is a project that uses an Adafruit QT Py 2040 to build a controllable Turing Machine sequencer.

A Turing Machine is an implementation of an Linear Feedback Shift Register with a random component.

## Parts List

- 1x [Adafruit QT Py 2040](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4900)
- 2x [STEMMA QT cables](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4399) 
- 1x [128 x 64 OLED Display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/326)
- 1x [Adafruit Rotary Encoder with Neopixel](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4991)
- 1x [Rotary Encoder](https://www.adafruit.com/product/377)

## Build

The good news is that there is only a little soldering required - soldering the rotary encoder to the Neopixel board. There are five total contacts you will need to solder.

You can optionally solder header pins to the QT Py itself - this will help you out if you decide to breadboard the project to add other extras (such as a serial MIDI out).
